Here are some ways _you_ can contribute:

- Write or edit documentation.
- Write specifications.

- Refactor code.
- Write and/or work on [issues](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/front-back-integration-template/issues).

## Submitting an issue

This project uses the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ArielMAJ/front-back-integration-template/issues) to track bugs and features.
Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure no one else has already submitted the same bug report.

When submitting a bug report, please include any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including the version of the project, Python/Node/Bun versions, and operating system.

## Writing code

After you run `make install`, `pre-commit` will be installed. Make sure to always run the pre-commits before
committing and making PRs. If youâ€™re adding new functionality, it would be awesome if you could also provide tests and documentation to cover it, but don't let this stop you from contributing.
